# Computational-Chemistry-in-MATLAB
This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts I have written over my time at university. It includes a number of scripts outlining numerical techniques within Chemistry including Kinetic and Quantum Mechanical calculations, as well as code which finds use within Computational Chemistry such as the production of coordinate files for Molecular Dynamics simulations. Hopefully, these scripts will prove useful or insightful for those with an interest in Computational Chemistry or Molecular Physics.
