This directory contains a number of MATLAB scripts related to Quantum Mechanical calculations within Chemistry. Specifically, these scripts generate isosurface plots for the
Hydrogen atom solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation. Namely the 1s, 2p, 3d, and 4f orbitals from their Angular and Radial Wavefunctions.
