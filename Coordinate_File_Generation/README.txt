This directory contains MATLAB scripts outlining how to produce .xyz coordinate files for simple molecules. Coordinate files are used widely within Molecular Dynamics simulations as starting structures for molecular systems, prior to any Energy Minimisations, or NVT/NPT Equilibrations. The scripts presented here should hopefully offer insight into how molecular coordinates can be constructed from scratch, purely from the principles of molecular symmetry. Scripts will outline how to use rotation and reflection matrices to contruct molecules, as well as the techniques used to construct said files in the correct format.
